**An attempt to expand on the excellent work of balenAIR**

#Pre-Alpha work - You have been warned!

This project is new iteration on the balenAIR project and attempts to add some enhanced functionality including the the ability
to have a graphical UI local to the device and the ability to collect information from other devices in the balenAIR family.  By itself it is a completely contained air quaility monitor with a navigatable touch screen display.  When combined with other devices it comes a centralized plaform for displaing the air quality of multiple locations along with historical information.   

A new alerting system will provide not only warnings about current hazardous conditions but also display furture trending information to predict possible hazardous situations.
